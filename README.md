How Ukraine war is affecting the world? The Russia-Ukraine war is having an outsized impact on the global supply chain, impeding the flow of goods, fueling dramatic cost increases and product shortages, and creating catastrophic food shortages around the world, Skymaz was intrested to make an assesment ot measure the impact worldwide

Web scraping - Data collection and cleaning by python:
Creation of a bot that extracts data from reliable sites recognized as:
    - open data from Statista
    - open data of the Global Economy
    - open data of SIPRI
    - open data of Databank 
##The project includes two main areas:
  - Data visualization in power BI
  - Data analysis and construction of predictions using different algorithms and precision calculation 
    to choose the appropriate model.
Intelligent visualization involves the use of DAX-queries. The system allows the user to quickly find the impact points of the Ukrainian war on several sectors (Alimentary/Army/Tourism...etc ) within the framework of the collected data.
To predict the consequences of the war in the coming months/years, different machine learning algorithms were used, such as linear regression/ARIMA/SARIMAX. These algorithms have been tested on the inflation rate as well as on imports/exports arms and military expenditure of Ukraine and Russia for the coming years, thus, the calculation of some coefficients such as accuracy and seasonality helps to choose the adequate prediction model.
